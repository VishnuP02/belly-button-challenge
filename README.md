Task: In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Resources used to complete this challenge:
  - Lecture Slides, Class recordings, StackOverflow, AskBCS session w/ Learning Assistants Dinh Chau and Khan Maphanda
